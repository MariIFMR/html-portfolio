<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>I would definetly recommend showing this one to your children. I was obsessed with it when I was young, a classic!</p>
<h3>ALIVE</h3>
<p>This one is a Korean action movie, centers around a young guy amid a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<h3>Sing</h3>
<p>Comes out as a very cute animal movie, but really it has a lot of important messages about relationships and today's society.</p>
